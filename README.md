# Curvature-in-Control-Exploring-the-Tait-Kneser-Theorem
This repository contains a mathematical investigation into how curvature shapes geometry and motion, focusing on the Taitâ€“Kneser Theorem. The theorem states that for curves with monotonic curvature, osculating circles are both nested and disjoint. This work examines the geometric intuition behind the theorem, provides step-by-step computations of osculating circles, and analyzes cases where the monotonic curvature condition fails.

The project includes:

* Detailed explanations of curvature, osculating circles, and monotonic curvature.

* Worked examples with explicit calculations for different curves.

* A counterexample illustrating the breakdown of the theorem when curvature is not monotonic.

* A generalized vector-calculus method for finding centers of osculating circles.

* Applications in computer-aided design, architectural modeling, and vehicle kinematics.

This resource is intended for anyone interested in differential geometry, mathematical modeling, and computational geometry, from students learning the basics to researchers exploring advanced applications.
