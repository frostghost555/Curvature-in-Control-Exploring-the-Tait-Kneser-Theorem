# Curvature-in-Control-Exploring-the-Tait-Kneser-Theorem
A mathematical investigation of how curvature shapes geometry and motion through the Taitâ€“Kneser Theorem, examining curves and their osculating circles, core ideas in differential geometry, and applications in design, modeling, and kinematics, with proofs, counterexamples, and computational methods.
